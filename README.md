# README

This an open-source project to help Heroes of Might and Magic II fans
find and select maps that they would like to play

Currently its pre-alpha version without any eligable interface.

Core files are:

[map.rb](lib/map.rb) which allows to to get map basic info: map size, diffuclty, number of humans, ets.

[selector.rb](lib/selector.rb ) which helps to select desired maps by their attributes and copy to `desired_maps` folder

Feel free to open PR's, let's make it great!

## Future plans

* create web interface for uploading/selecting/downloading maps
* user account to mark map as played
* deploy it somewhere (will be happy is somebody will share hosting with me :) )
